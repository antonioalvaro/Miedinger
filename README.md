Miedinger*
=========

Miedinger* is based off of the work of Max Miedinger. 
Initially I set out to make as faithful a replicant of Helvetica as possible. I have sense had a change of heart and intended to scrap the current font and design a new, Helvetica inspired one. I did, however, finish creating two weights before this change of heart, which are available.
